### Instructions

1. Fork this repo (So you can pull updates from us time to time)
1. Start new machine - `docker-machine create -d virtualbox dev`. [more drivers](https://docs.docker.com/machine/drivers/)
1. Configure your shell to use the new machine environment - `eval $(docker-machine env dev)`
1. Change the `build` paths in the `docker-compose.yml` file to point to your local repositories
1. Make sure that there is a [`.dockerignore`](.dockerignore) file in each of your repositories that ignores unwanted files/folders line venv, .git, node_modules folders, etc.
1. Build images - `docker-compose build`
1. Start services - `docker-compose up -d`
1. Create migrations - `docker-compose exec worker /usr/local/bin/python manage.py migrate` (Please ensure you are not running this command in backend and image that might receive traffic from traefik. Because you don't want a request  to come to this container and fail. )
1. Grab IP - `docker-machine ip dev` - and view in your browser


### Scaling

Suppose you want to run X `backend` containers and Y `worker` containers: `docker-compose scale backend=X worker=Y`


### S3 Based front-end deplotment

Refer our S3 deployment guide: [S3_FRONTEND_DEPLOYMENT.md](S3_FRONTEND_DEPLOYMENT.md)


### Importing / Exporting Docker Machines

Use the `machine-share` npm package. Check out the docs on this GitHub repo: [bhurlow/machine-share](https://github.com/bhurlow/machine-share)

### Inspecting / Deleting Volumes

* To list your volumes: `docker volume ls`
* To inspect a volume: `docker volume inspect my_volume_name`
* To remove a volume: `docker volume rm my_volume_name`


### Troubleshooting

Refer our troubleshooting guide: [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

### Kubernetes

We can use [Kompose](https://kompose.io/) to deploy to kubernetes. Just do [`kompose up`](https://kompose.io/getting-started/).

### Support

Reckonsys offers paid support to containerize your applications (Compose, Swarm, Kubernetes, Mesos, etc..). Please contact [info@reckonsys.com](mailto:info@reckonsys.com) for more details.
